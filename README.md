# OvarianTeratoma
Code for the teratoma project could not be shared due to OHSU <br/>
restrictions on handling patient information. Slides from the <br/>
presentation have been posted to describe the entire project <br/>.

# Description
An ovarian germ cell teratoma is a tumor made up of several different <br/>
types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, or bone arising from gamete cells.<br/>
Little is known about the genomics of immature ovarian teratomas. Thus, <br/>
I sought out to conduct a copy number analysis on them to shed more light <br/>
on their origination.
